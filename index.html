    <h3>Knowledge About <span class="n">COVID-19</span></h3>
      <img class="corona" src="images/corona.png" alt="corona">
    <p class="knowledge">Coronaviruses are a group of related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus">RNA viruses</a> that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
      Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is caused also by certain other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome">SARS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome">MERS</a>, and <span>COVID-19</span>. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they
      cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</p>
    <p class="knowledge1">In late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.
      The rest is part of an awful history still in the making,
      with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of Chinaâ€™s Hubei province
      to a pandemic that has killed about 211,000 people so far.</p>

    <h3>How Does Corona Spreads</h3>
    <img class="spread" src="images/spread.jpg" alt="corona spread">
    <p class="knowledge2">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.
    The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks.
    These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground.
    People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.
    This is why it is important to stay at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from others.
    These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.
    People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
    This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub. </p>

    <h3>Symptoms of COVID-19</h3>
      <img class="symptoms" src="images/symptoms.png" alt="corona-symptoms">
    <p class="syminfo"> The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
        only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
        those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with
        very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
